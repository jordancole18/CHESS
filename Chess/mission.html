                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We have noticed a gross underutilization of technology resources at local schools, with both the faculty and students failing to use the full power of the tech on campus. We aim to improve this. Namely, we have
                            developed a easy to use system to connect the existing potential in computational power all that sitting computing power into a scalable cluster server - essentially a supercomputer, for administrator, student, and club use.<br></p>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On this cluster, websites could be hosted for whatever the need may be, for no more than negligible expense to the school, rather than paying for pricey and distant hosting services. Clubs would be able to inexpensively
                            increase their impact and outreach, potentially including ads or donation services to increase revenue, opening up even more opportunities to the students. Moreover, individual students with interest in STEM and computer science
                            could explore subjects previously inaccessible because of expensive hardware limitations. The exploding fields of machine learning or data science could reach a whole new caliber of exploration, all things software development,
                            dev, devops, and ops, could be explored hands on by students. Furthermore, depending on the demands of the school, all the school’s data needs could be handled and managed onsite without the need of expensive solution, saving
                            schools money and making more room to budget for students and teachers. All of this is simply locked up sitting there, but our tech can unlock this unbridled potential for schools in a way never previously explored.<br></p>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Our objective was to make CHESS as user-friendly and seamless to integrate as possible, because creating similar clusters without it is far from user friendly and requires extensive knowledge. But with a simple
                            installation and activation, the computers are now clustered as one. Machine learning based adaptive algorithms manage load and system needs, letting students use the computers as per normal, and the remaining resources intelligently
                            allocated to the cluster seamlessly with little to no performance degradation to the network connection or to the user. Admittedly, this will impact cluster performance during external use, but our adaptive management system
                            would make this as minimal as possible, and our helpful localized website could be accessed to manually adjust the trade off between user and cluster performance. This website aggregates resource information about the cluster
                            down to a node to node basis. Computing schedule, hardware performance, location, history, project and website upload, are all accessible, live, through the intuitive web page.<br></p>
                        <figure></figure>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In conclusion, CHESS aims to expand schools’, clubs’, and students’ capabilities by clustering existing underutilized hardware in an intuitive and accessible manner. In the modern times, the internet is an unparalleled
                            tool for outreach, with the work of few being able to impact the world, and CHESS serves to bridge the gap that divides our hearths of learning and the globe. Moreover, schools serve to connect students to resources and knowledge
                            to explore, and those who feel held back by their access to technology or economic situation in school now can be free to work hands on with high level STEM, which craves prepared and competent people. Playing CHESS will give
                            schools and students the ability to leverage existing resources to greatly expand their realized potential.<br></p>
